		<h1>'Pong' Game</h1>

				This mobile application is a game in which a single ball is moved down the screen and must be stopped by the 'paddle' before it reaches the bottom. The ball bounces off the paddle and must be continually hit to increase score, much like a solo version of ping-pong. It was created in the course Game Design 2 using MIT App Inventor, and their tutorial which can be found <a href="http://www.appinventor.org/content/CourseInABox/drawAnimate/PongTutorial" target="_blank" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline">here</a>.

				The code, in the form of a block interface, dictates the paddle moving with the user's touch along the x-axis, as well as the reset, start, and sound buttons functionality. The ball is set to bounce off of edges, but end the game if that edge happens to be the lower one. The ball also is set to bounce off of the paddle and increase the score as it does so.
