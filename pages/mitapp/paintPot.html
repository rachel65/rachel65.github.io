				This mobile application allows the user draw using three different colors onto an image of a cow. It was created in the course Game Design 2 using MIT App Inventor, and their tutorial which can be found <a href="http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/ai2/paintpot-part1.html" target="_blank" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline">here</a> and <a href="http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/ai2/paintpot-part2.html" target="_blank" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline">here</a>. The cow image used can be found <a href="http://www.saawinternational.org/cow2.jpg" target="_blank" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline">here</a>.

				The code, in the form of a block interface, first assigns each button with its respective color. Much like the previous drawing application, when the user touches the canvas the location is noted. A line is then drawn from where the user started to touch the screen, to where they stopped. There is an additional function to allow for the drawing of single dots when the user only touches the screen. A button has also been added to the bottom, which simply clears the entire canvas of all drawings.
